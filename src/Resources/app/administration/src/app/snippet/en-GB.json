            "bodyHtml": "<p>ADDRESSFACTORY DIRECT is a service of Deutsche Post Direkt for validating address data.<br>This plugin integrates ADDRESSFACTORY DIRECT services into Shopware so that you can check the customer's shipping address before fulfilling the order. Address validation can be performed either manually or automatically after the order was placed. The address will be checked with regards to the format of the address (zipcode, street and city) as well as the probability of a successful delivery to the person at this address.<br>Basis for this check is the postal reference file from Deutsche Post Direkt. This database is unique in Germany with around 210 million current and former private addresses for validating purposes.</p> <h2>To get started:</h2> <p>You need a valid Deutsche Post Direkt account. If you do not have an account yet or your account is not enabled for DATAFACTORY AUTOCOMPLETE, please use the <a href=\"https://www.postdirekt.de/autocomplete\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Deutsche Post Direkt</a> website to use our address solutions.</p>"
