**ADDRESSFACTORY DIRECT** is a service of Deutsche Post Direkt, a 100% subsidiary of the world’s leading mail and logistics company Deutsche Post DHL Group, which specialized in address and data management.
The service offers highly effective assistance in validating and correcting shipment address data.

This module integrates the ADDRESSFACTORY DIRECT service into Shopware 6 and enables you to check the customer’s delivery address in Germany before shipping the order.
After an order has been placed, you can manually or automatically check the destination address.
The information will be validated and, if necessary, corrected regarding spelling and plausibility (street, zip code, city).
Furthermore, the probability of successful delivery is shown.

The basis for this process is the postal reference database from Deutsche Post Direkt.
This database is unique in Germany and contains around 210 million current and former private addresses for validating purposes.
